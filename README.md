## About
This is a rip-off of [Discord's Halloween Bot](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057167253-Halloween-Bot-2020) which got decommissioned after 2020. You can [invite the bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1026089209880133692&permissions=268495872&scope=bot%20applications.commands) to your server, but it will remain offline until October. 

> Once you add our Halloween bot to your server, 40 unique trick-or-treaters will start knockin' on your door for some sweet treats. Don't worry, they're not actual random people joining!
> 
> Itâ€™s a game based on speed, with whoever giving a trick or treat to the guest first receiving an item for their game inventory. The items to collect range from common trinkets such as HairballðŸ™€ to ultra-rare collectibles like a Miniature CrownðŸ‘‘.
> 
> The bot can show a scoreboard of whoâ€™s closest to completing their collection of trick-or-treat prizes, andÂ whoever has the most items in your server will be given a special role called the "Champion of Halloween!"
> 
> Only one person can have this role, so gather some more items and take their orange crown from them!
